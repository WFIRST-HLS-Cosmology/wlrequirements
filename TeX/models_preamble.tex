We need a model to associate high-level requirements for each source of systematic error (e.g.\ a limit on $Z$, $A_0$, etc.) to low-level requirements on its source (e.g.\ wavefront drift rate in nm/hr). This section collects the models used for these systematics. Note that none of the models used -- at least in the pre-launch phase -- will be anywhere near a complete description of the WFIRST telescope, instrument, and pipeline. Rather the intention is to capture the features of WFIRST that are most important for that source of systematic error.
