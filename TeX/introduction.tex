\CMH{Add general background on WFIRST}

This document describes the requirements flowdown and error budgeting for the weak lensing program on the WFIRST mission, and documents the detailed rationale behind the summary requirements listed in the WFIRST SRD. This kind of error budgeting has been performed elsewhere in the literature \citep[e.g.][]{2008A&A...484...67P,2013MNRAS.429..661M}, but this document focuses on the error terms relevant to WFIRST. For example, the PSFs are based on an obstructed pupil with low-order aberrations rather than using generic formulae involving second moments (some such formulae, including those used in the JDEM and WFIRST-IDRM studies, were for Gaussians). This analysis supersedes the preliminary investigations on PSF ellipticity requirements derived for the IDRM \citep{2011arXiv1108.1374G}.

We will set most systematics requirements for this mission on the basis of having systematic errors subdominant to statistical errors in the WL shear power spectra or cross-power spectra (or any linear combinations thereof). Exceptions to this policy will be considered in cases where meeting the original systematic budget becomes a cost or complexity driver, or is not possible. Most measurement biases fall into the ``additive'' or ``multiplicative'' forms (see \S\ref{sec:add_mult}) and will be treated according to the formalism therein. Other sources of systematic error will be treated in their own dedicated sections.
